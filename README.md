# My-library-Library-helper
This is a library-management web-site which will easily upgrade any university library schema.

There exist two basic roles, normal user and superior user.

The roles are very simple to understand. The normal user can issue a book by scanning QR code which is applied on book from library, in addition to that the status of each book can be seen.
The normal user can see the recommended books for subjects.

Isn't it that simple?

The role of superior user is also very simple, the new  books can be added by superior user and the recommedation can be set by him.
In addition to that he can take the book return which is being issued by normal user. Also various reports can be generated by superior user.

So, take a tour to explore this. Not a perfect implementation but tried to handle backend by learning PHP from scratch in 4 months during semester-4 CE for SGP.
